`manual-classifier` is a simple Python GUI tool for manually classifying text blocks in PDF files. The tool displays each block of text from a PDF, allowing users to classify them as "Header," "Body," "Footer," or "Quote" using buttons or keyboard shortcuts (1-4). Users can also undo the last classification. The tool saves the classifications to an output file.

### How to use:
1. Run `manually_classify.py`.
2. Enter the PDF file name when prompted.
3. Use the GUI to classify each text block.
4. The classifications are saved to `output.txt`.
